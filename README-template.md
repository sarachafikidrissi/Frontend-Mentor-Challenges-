## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

While working on this project i have learnt how to use div's and style them correctly

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container">

    <div class="qr-code">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
    </div>

        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
    </p>
</div>
```
```css
.container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    width: 250px;
    height: 400px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 150px auto auto auto;
    
}
```

### Continued development

In the future i want to focus on how to use flexbox or css grid and master them so i can use them in my next projects
